    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Hi, we’re Rose Ricks and Mary Deng…and together we are the Flipping moms—sisters, mothers, and real estate
      investors
      here in the Roanoke River Valley!! Despite being sisters and best friends, we decided that we weren’t spending
      enough
      time together, so we went into business. Now, we may not look like typical investors, but since beginning our
      journey in
      2018, we have flipped several properties, acquired multiple rental houses, made over $250K in profits, and started
      coaching students to do the same!
      <br>
      When we started investing, we were just two mothers in search of a career that would allow us to spend time with
      our
      children and help us achieve financial freedom. We knew NOTHING! We faced many ups and downs on our first
      investment
      property, that we almost gave up. But because we relied on each other and believed in our abilities, we forged
      ahead and
      completed the project in less than one month and had it sold within a few days. It’s only been up since then.
      Although
      our lives have been changed since we picked up investing, it’s no longer just about us: now, it’s so much more.
      <br>
      Real estate investing and consulting have offered us the opportunity to give back to our community and learn more
      about
      our friends and neighbors. We specialize in working with property owners to renovate and rehab their distressed or
      dated
      homes to be sold on the market. Through the work we’ve done, we’ve been able to help several people avoid
      foreclosures,
      bankruptcies, and settle probate properties. Seeing the positive impact we could have on others, has made us more
      determined than ever to find additional ways to encourage and inspire those in our society. Therefore, after every
      flip,
      we will be giving a money grant out to a community group doing good in the neighborhood.
      <br>
      <br>
      So, the question is: <em>How can we help?</em>
